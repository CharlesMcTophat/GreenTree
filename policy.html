					<h3 class="subtitle">CHINESE POLICY</h3>
					<hr class = "titleGreenLine2" color = "#26B54D"/>
					<p>China’s 2020 Three Red Line policy limits developers wi-
llingness to acquire debt, increases equity investment
requirements, and pushes developers to adjust their
balance sheets by selling projects enbloc to investors.
China’s 2020 Three Red Line policy defines 3 debt me-
trics and classifies developers based on their complian-
ce. The 3 debt metrics are (1)asset-liability ratio below
70%, (2) net debt ratio below 100%, (3) cash-short-term
debt ratio below 1.</p>
					<p>Any debt metric a real estate developer or subsidiary
surpasses causes the developers rating to be down-
graded. Developers can obtain favorable interest rates
such as 5%, 10%, 15%, by having a better rating. “Red”
developers are not able to access any new lending.</p>
					<p>GreenTree, an investment sales operator, benefits from
Three Red Line policy. Greentree acquires completed
enbloc projects from illiquid developers and strata sells
the individual units. GreenTree, an asset management
company, is not affected by the Red Line policy.</p>

					<hr class = "titleGreenLine2" color = "#FFFFFF"/>
					<p>Greentree and Tony Jiang are able to obtain discounts
from developers because of our reputation asan indus-
try leader who offers fast and good faith acquisition
offers consistent payment execution. Developers re-
ceive offers from various non-serious buyers, and deve-
lopers will offer non-serious terms in response. Howe-
ver, GreenTree is able to obtain real, discounted offers
due to Greentree’s market experience, reputation, and
past successful cooperation.</p>
					<p>Asset-liability ratio-70%</p>
					<p>Net debt ratio-71.4%</p>
					<p>Cash to short-term debt 1.29.</p>
					<p>We estimate around half of the 201 developers have
the red color and are unable to acquire new debt.</p>
