					<h3 class="subtitle">GREENTREE’S VALUE ADD</h3>
					<hr class = "titleGreenLine2" color = "#26B54D"/>
					<p>Greentree offers sophisticated value add solutions that
are irreplaceable and vastly different than a typical PE
firm. Greentree provides project identification, acqui-
sition negotiation, developer liquidity, strata asset pri-
cing, sales strategies, sales rep negotiation, onsite sales
management, property management and leasing solu-
tions. Greentree’s value add creates margins between
the developer and the market price.</p>
					<h3 class="subtitle">PROJECT IDENTIFICATION</h3>
					<hr class = "titleGreenLine2" color = "#26B54D"/>
					<p>Greentree identifies and underwrites projects risk, pri-
cing and strategies while simultaneously negotiating
with the developer and 3rd party sales rep companies.
Greentree’s quickly prices each property deed, obtains
contract terms from sales rep companies and makes
genuine acquisition offers to developers. Our market
resources and back-to-back negotiation ability is value
add irreplicable by typical PE firms. Greentree is a sales
investment industry leader and Greentree’s manage-
ment team has 40 years of real estate and sales expe-
rience.</p>

	<h3 class="subtitle">ACQUISITION NEGOTIATION</h3>
					<hr class = "titleGreenLine2" color = "#26B54D"/>
					<p>Greentree and Tony Jiang are able to obtain discounts
from developers because of our reputation asan indus-
try leader who offers fast and good faith acquisition
offers consistent payment execution. Developers re-
ceive offers from various non-serious buyers, and deve-
lopers will offer non-serious terms in response. Howe-
ver, GreenTree is able to obtain real, discounted offers
due to Greentree’s market experience, reputation, and
past successful cooperation.</p>
					<h3 class="subtitle">DEVELOPER LIQUIDITY SOLUTIONS</h3>
					<hr class = "titleGreenLine2" color = "#26B54D"/>
					<p>Greentree will typically pay 30-% of the project upfront
and the remainder within 6-9 months. For many deve-
lopers, the 30% payment is used to immediately solve
significant cash flow requirements of other projects.</p>
